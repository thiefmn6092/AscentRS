ASCENT RUNESCAPE 2 SERVER EMULATOR.

Libraries this software uses:
- jython2.5.2
- mina-core-2.0.4
- mysql-connector-java-5.1.20-bin
- slf4j-api-1.6.6
- slf4j-jdk14-1.6.6

Be sure to have all of these in your classpath otherwise the program will not start or will crash.

Developing the Server:
Generally, the core and content of Ascent is kept separate. Content added to the server should be scripted.
You can find scripts in the ./scripts/ directory in the root directory. It is more than possible with what is
included here to script the whole server in Python in its entirety. This means that you could have multiple
protocol version support just by scripting it. If you were to do so, you would have to uncomment the lines
involving the script manager in the codec and in the entity updating tasks and implement the functions invoked.
In the future, I may provide these scripts already pre-written for you in the case that you may wish to take
this route. For my own personal use, I've developed Ascent emulator purely for the version 317 of the RuneScape
client. The server will function as-is without the use of scripts. This is why I've implemented the 317
network protocol in Java as part of the core of the program. A purely-scriptable version of the server can be
built just by exporting the core to a jar file and running it via command-line.
